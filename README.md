## Introduction
By integrating genetic, lifestyle, and environmental data into patient digital twins, healthcare providers can deliver personalized treatment plans tailored to individual needs and genetic profiles. Patient digital twins enable continuous remote monitoring of vital signs, medication adherence, and disease progression. This proactive approach facilitates early intervention and reduces hospital readmissions.
